## ANNEX 1: Data Management Plan (DMP) template

The purpose of the Data Management Plan (DMP) is to provide an analysis of the
main elements of the data management policy that will be used by the applicants
with regard to all the datasets that will be generated by the project.

The DMP is not a fixed document, but evolves during the lifespan of the project.

The DMP should address the points below on a dataset by dataset basis and should
reflect the current status of reflection within the consortium about the data
that will be produced.

### Data set reference and name

Identifier for the data set to be produced.

### Data set description

Description of the data that will be generated or collected, its origin (in case
it is collected), nature and scale and to whom it could be useful, and whether
it underpins a scientific publication. Information on the existence (or not) of
similar data and the possibilities for integration and reuse.

### Standards and metadata

Reference to existing suitable standards of the discipline. If these do not
exist, an outline on how and what metadata will be created.

### Data sharing

Description of how data will be shared, including access procedures, embargo
periods (if any), outlines of technical mechanisms for dissemination and
necessary software and other tools for enabling re-use, and definition of
whether access will be widely open or restricted to specific groups.
Identification of the repository where data will be stored, if already existing
and identified, indicating in particular the type of repository (institutional,
standard repository for the discipline, etc.). In case the dataset cannot be
shared, the reasons for this should be mentioned (e.g. ethical, rules of
personal data, intellectual property, commercial, privacy-related,
security-related).

### Archiving and preservation (including storage and backup)

Description of the procedures that will be put in place for long-term
preservation of the data. Indication of how long the data should be preserved,
what is its approximated end volume, what the associated costs are and how these
are planned to be covered.

## ANNEX 2: Additional guidance for Data Management Plans

This can be applied to any project that produces, collects or processes research
data, and is included here as reference for elaborating DMPs in Horizon 2020
projects. This guide is structures as a series of questions that should be
ideally clarified for all datasets produced in the project.

### Scientific research data should be easily

1. **Discoverable**  
   Are the data and associated software produced and/or used in the project
   discoverable (and readily located), identifiable by means of a standard
   identification mechanism (e.g. Digital Object Identifier)?
2. **Accessible**  
   Are the data and associated software produced and/or used in the project
   accessible and in what modalities, scope, licenses (e.g. licencing framework
   for research and education, embargo periods, commercial exploitation, etc.)?
3. **Assessable and intelligible**    
   Are the data and associated software produced and/or used in the project
   assessable for and intelligible to third parties in contexts such as
   scientific scrutiny and peer review (e.g. are the minimal datasets handled
   together with scientific papers for the purpose of peer review, are data is
   provided in a way that judgments can be made about their reliability and the
   competence of those who created them)?
4. **Useable beyond the original purpose for which it was collected**  
   Are the data and associated software produced and/or used in the project
   useable by third parties even long time after the collection of the data
   (e.g. is the data safely stored in certified repositories for long term
   preservation and curation; is it stored together with the minimum software,
   metadata and documentation to make it useful; is the data useful for the
   wider public needs and usable for the likely purposes of non-specialists)?
5. **Interoperable to specific quality standards**  
   Are the data and associated software produced and/or used in the project
   interoperable allowing data exchange between researchers, institutions,
   organisations, countries, etc. (e.g. adhering to standards for data
   annotation, data exchange, compliant with available software applications,
   and allowing re-combinations with different datasets from different origins)?
